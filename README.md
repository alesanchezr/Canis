# Canis PHP Development Framework

I built this framework a long time ago when there where not famous PHP frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, etc. I stop developing it because it was hard to mantain it by myself and I the other frameworks started rising strong.

It has Doctrine 2 as ORM and a file called Bindings.xml as main controller.

Today, in 2016 I still like a lot of the ideas that the architecture had but I guess we will never know how those ideas would have evolved.

## Are you looking for a PHP Framework?

- For any common website, mid-size ecommerce and LMS definetly WordPress is the way to go and I recommend you to use my [Wordpress Developer Starter Theme ](https://github.com/alesanchezr/wordpress-for-developers) to save you some troubles!
- If you are building an API then [Slim PHP](https://www.slimframework.com/) is a great option, I love its simplicity.
- For any other customized MVC development [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is the best option.
